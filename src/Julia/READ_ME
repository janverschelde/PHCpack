interface for Julia based on the shared object libPHCpack in PHCv2.4.86

This folder was added in release 2.4.86, after the definition
of phclib.gpr which builds libPHCpack with GPRbuild.

For the Julia code to work, the file ../lib/libPHCpack,
with the extension .so (Linux), .dll (Windows), or .dylib (Mac OS X)
must be present.
