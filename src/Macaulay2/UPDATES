Thu 20 Oct 2016 : in PHCpackDoc.m2, fixed the seeds for solveSystem in
  some examples, to avoid unlucky choices.

Wed 19 Oct 2016 : for testing purposes, turning LRhomotopies.m2 with its
  documentation in LRhomotopiesDoc.m2 into a standalone package.
  The generated generic flags and the solution planes are now returned
  as proper complex matrices in Macaulay2.
  Updated PHCpackDoc.m2, 'roots' has become protected, which caused
  problems with the documentation of refineSolutions.

Tue 18 Oct 2016 : updated LRhomotopies.m2 with functions to extract the
  solution planes of the output.

Tue 14 Oct 2015 : updated LRhomotopies.m2 for changes in phc -e.

Thu 21 May 2015 : fixed bug in mixedVolume function of PHCpack.m2 which
  was introduced with the polyhedral homotopies in double double and
  quad double arithmetic.  Needs version 2.3.97 of PHCpack.

Thu 30 Oct 2014 : updated LRhomotopies.m2 to solve general problems, tested
  R := ZZ; n := 6; m := matrix{{4, 3, 6}}; which is the [3 6]^4 problem.
  
Wed 24 Sep 2014 : fixed bug in systemFromFile in PHCpack.m2 and added
  parsing routines to LRhomotopies.m2.

Tue 23 Sep 2014 : figured out how to replace the "e+00" with regular 
  expressions when parsing systems from file.
