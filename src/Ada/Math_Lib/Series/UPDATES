  and basic input/output of systems of series polynomials.
  Instantiated standard_series_poly_sysfun and standard_series_jaco_matrices,
  with a new test procedure ts_sersys.

Sat 18 Jun 2016 : added get/put procedures to series_and_polynomials_io,
  encapsulating the get/put of ordinary polynomials.  Instantiated the

Thu 16 Jun 2016 : instantiated standard_series_poly_functions, tested by
  ts_serpol.  Fixed Add() and Sub() so that order of the series is updated
  as well in case the other series has a higher order.  Fixed Mul() as well
  and updated the specifications, with a modification in ts_serpol.adb.

Wed 15 Jun 2016 : new package series_and_polynomials to convert polynomials
  with complex coefficients into polynomials with series coefficients, and
  vice versa, tested by ts_serpol.adb.

Tue 14 Jun 2016 : instantiated new standard_series_polynomials,
  tested by ts_serpol.adb.  In standard_dense_series, fixed copy.

Sun 12 Jun 2016 : defined standard_dense_series_matrices and extended
  standard_random_series with a random_matrix_series function, tested
  by ts_sermat.adb.  New package standard_linear_series_solvers to solve
  systems of truncated power series with LU factorization.

Sat 11 Jun 2016 : new package standard_random_series with code factored out
  from the test ts_series.  Extended the package with random vectors.

Fri 10 Jun 2016 : new package standard_algebraic_series with the sqrt code
  from ts_series.  Extended standard_algebraic_series and ts_series with

  standard_dense_series with operations with complex numbers and added
  a power function.  A sqrt is added to ts_series.

  in standard_dense_series_io, tested by ts_series, to encapsulate the
  standard complex vectors data type.
