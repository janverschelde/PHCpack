Thu 9 Jun 2016 : rewrote standard_dense_series to use a definite type for
  making the standard_dense_series_ring and standard_dense_series_vectors.
  The test programs are ts_series and ts_servec.  Extended the package
  standard_dense_series with operations with complex numbers and added
  a power function.  A sqrt is added to ts_series.

Wed 8 Jun 2016 : new package standard_dense_series, with a very basic output
  in standard_dense_series_io, tested by ts_series, to encapsulate the
  standard complex vectors data type.
