Truncated power series with complex coefficients for PHCv2.4.21

Similar to Taylor series approximations for general functions,
we can approximate roots of polynomials in a parameter by series.

The library is divided in three parts:
(1) the basic arithmetic with truncated power series
(2) vectors, matrices, and linear solving
(3) polynomials with coefficients as truncated power series
