-- DESCRIPTION :
--   A series polynomial is a polynomial which has series for coefficients.
--   A polynomial series is a series which has polynomials for coefficients.

  type Poly ( deg : integer32 ) is record
    cff : HexaDobl_Complex_Poly_Systems.Poly_Sys(0..deg);
     -- coefficients of the series are polynomials in several variables
     -- the number of variables should be the same for all polynomials
  end record;

-- CONSTRUCTORS :

  function Create ( p : HexaDobl_CSeries_Polynomials.Poly )
                  return HexaDobl_Polynomial_CSeries.Poly;

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Converts a polynomial p with series coefficients into a series
  --   which has polynomials for coefficients.

  function Create ( p : HexaDobl_Polynomial_CSeries.Poly )
                  return HexaDobl_CSeries_Polynomials.Poly;

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Converts a series p which has polynomials for coefficients
  --   into a polynomial with series coefficients.

-- DESTRUCTOR :

  procedure Clear ( p : in out HexaDobl_Polynomial_CSeries.Poly );

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Deallocates all coefficients in the series p.
  --   On return, p.deg = -1.
