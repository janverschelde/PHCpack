Fri 14 Nov 2014 : to random_conditioned_evaluations, added versions to
  generate polynomial systems with prescribed condition numbers.

Tue 11 Nov 2014 : added to varbprec_polynomial_evaluations estimators of
  the condition number for polynomial systems and for Laurent polynomials.
  Added the Laurent polynomial of Stefano Taschini to ts_vmpeval.adb.

Mon 10 Nov 2014 : extended random_conditioned_evaluations with functions
  and procedures to fix the gradient of a random polynomial at a point,
  tested by ts_vmpeval.adb.  To varbprec_polynomial_evaluations added
  procedure to evaluate polynomials with condition number computation.

Sun 9 Nov 2014 : extended varbprec_polynomial_evaluations with double double
  and quad double versions; new package random_conditioned_evaluations
  to generate evaluation problems with prescribed condition number,
  for testing ts_vmpeval.adb.  Added arbitrary multprecision versions to the
  packages random_conditioned_evaluations and varbprec_polynomial_evaluations.

Sat 8 Nov 2014 : new package varbprec_polynomial_evaluations tested by
  ts_vmpeval.adb.

Fri 25 Jul 2014 : Fixed several bugs in generic_laur_poly_functions.adb,
  tested by ts_laurpoly.adb in ../Polynomials.  Did similar updates for
  the coefficient polynomial evaluation in generic_poynomial_functions,
  tested by ts_poly.adb in ../Polynomials;  multprec_complex_laur_functions
  and multprec_complex_laur_sysfun.ads are new instantiations to evaluate 
  multiprecision complex Laurent polynomials and Laurent systems.

Fri 4 Jul 2014 : extended exponent_vectors for double double coefficients
  and for quad double coefficients.

Mon 16 Jun 2014 : changes in ts_perfeval.adb for compiler warnings.

Thu 12 Jun 2014 : indexed version in standard_speelpenning_products,
  tested by ts_speel.  Also updated dobldobl_ and quaddobl_ versions.
  New test function ts_cycfun.adb to test on the cyclic n-roots problem.

Tue 10 Jun 2014 : eliminate bck vector in the reverse_speel function in
  standard_speelpenning_products, did the same for dobldobl and quaddobl.
  Improved the implementation in the general case for all precisions.

Sun 6 Apr 2014 : refactored function of standard_speelpenning_products.a*.
  Did the same for the double double and quad double versions.

Thu 27 Mar 2014 : updated standard_{gradient,jacobian}_evaluations
  for performance testing in ts_speelsys.adb.

Tue 25 Feb 2014 : updated ts_speelsys.adb to allow for benchmarking on the
  cyclic n-roots systems.  Extended standard_polynomial_flatteners with
  functions to concatenate supports of a polynomial system.

Sun 9 Jun 2013 : about half of the files in this directory changes because
  of the introduction of natural32 and integer32 types.

Fri 6 Jul 2012 : extended ts_perfeval.adb to measure the performance of
  the Jacobian evaluations.  Updates in standard_jacobian_evaluations.

Thu 5 Jul 2012 : creation of this new directory.  Changes to
  {dobldobl,quaddobl}_monomial_evaluations.adb and
  {dobldobl,quaddobl}_speelpenning_products.adb to deal with cases of
  constant monomials and monomials consisting of one variable.
  Changes to standard_polynomial_flatteners because of warnings.
  New packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_jacobian_evaluations, tested
  by ts_speelsys.adb.
