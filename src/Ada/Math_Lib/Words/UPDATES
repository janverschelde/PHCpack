Sat 26 Oct 2024 : new mask_bits_of_doubles to get the last and first bits
  of a 52-bit integer, as a fraction of doubles, tested by ts_maskbits.
  Added two procedures to test_bits_of_doubles, to avoid the arrays of
  naturals when chopping or inserting bits to fractions of doubles.
  New ts_ddbits to split high and low parts of double doubles.

Fri 25 Oct 2024 : extended test_bits_of_doubles.adb and bits_of_doubles
  with wrappers to insert bits to the fraction of a double.
