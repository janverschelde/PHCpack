Sat 7 Dec 2024 : extended bits_of_integers with a bit_size function,
  used in test_double_integers.adb to see that, with 60 bits or less,
  there is no carry over in the multiplication function.
  Add multiplication of double integers to double_integer_arithmetic,
  with added tests in test_double_integers.

Fri 6 Dec 2024 : bug fixed in the Value function of test_double_integers.adb,
  updated printing in double_integer_arithmetic.adb.
  Define a multiplication in double_integer_arithmetic,
  tested by test_double_integers.adb.

Thu 5 Dec 2024 : extended bits_of_integers and test_bits_of_integers
  with splitters of unsigned 64-bit integers into 30-bit words.
  Added double_integer_arithmetic and test_double_integers,
  with main test called in ts_dblint.adb, updated words.gpr.

Tue 3 Dec 2024 : new packages bits_of_integers, test_bits_of_integers,
  with procedure ts_intbits.adb, updated words.gpr.

Sat 2 Nov 2024 : new ts_splitdbl, extended bits_of_doubles, moved 
  procedures of ts_ddbits into bits_of_doubles.

Thu 31 Oct 2024 : new ts_vdda.adb to test vector sum of double doubles.

Mon 28 Oct 2024 : move split procedures from ts_ddbits.adb into the
  package bits_of_doubles, adding a check on a zero last part.
  Fixed ts_ddbits.adb by application of Double_Double_Basics.split.

Sat 26 Oct 2024 : new mask_bits_of_doubles to get the last and first bits
  of a 52-bit integer, as a fraction of doubles, tested by ts_maskbits.
  Added two procedures to test_bits_of_doubles, to avoid the arrays of
  naturals when chopping or inserting bits to fractions of doubles.
  New ts_ddbits to split high and low parts of double doubles.

Fri 25 Oct 2024 : extended test_bits_of_doubles.adb and bits_of_doubles
  with wrappers to insert bits to the fraction of a double.
