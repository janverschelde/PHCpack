Mon 14 Aug 2023 : new (double, quad, octo}_double_theta_algorithm, with
  updated test_theta_algorithm.adb to run the theta algorithm in double 
  double, quad double, and octo double precision.
  Edit in double_theta_algorithm.adb.  New double_rho_algorithm,
  test_rho_algorithm, ts_rho, updated end_games.gpr.

Sun 13 Aug 2023 : new double_theta_algorithm, test_theta_algorithm, and
  ts_theta.adb, updated end_games.gpr.  Integrated Initialize in the
  Extrapolate of double_theta_algorithm, updated test_theta_algorithm.adb.
  Improved test_theta_algorithm.adb.

Thu 10 Jun 2021 : added the exec_dir attribute to end_games.gpr.

Wed 9 Jun 2021 : defined end_games.gpr to build the test procedures.

Sun 8 Nov 2020 : updated driver_for_winding_numbers.adb for the renaming of
  drivers_for_poly_continuation into main_poly_continuation.

Sun 21 Apr 2019 : reformatted code in driver_for_winding_numbers.adb.

Mon 29 Feb 2016 : drivers_for_path_directions.adb changed for added
  parameter in dobldobl_incfix_continuation.

Sat 27 Feb 2016 : updates in drivers_for_path_directions.adb for changes in
  increment-and-fix continuation in standard double precision.

Wed 10 Feb 2016 : added silent procedure to standard_vlprs_algorithm
  and improved the silent update in directions_of_standard_paths.adb.
  Did the same for the dobldobl and quaddobl versions.

Tue 12 Jan 2016 : small fix in directions_of_dobldobl_paths.ads and updated
  directions_of_quaddobl_paths.adb.

Sun 10 Jan 2016 : improved directions_of_{dobldobl,quaddobl}_paths and
  directions_of_standard_paths.ads.

Sat 9 Jan 2016 : move specs in directions_of_{dobldobl,quaddobl}_paths,
  from the .adb to the .ads file.

Fri 8 Jan 2016 : in directions_of_{dobldobl,quaddobl}_paths.adb, improved 
  the output of the estimated winding numbers.  Made similar improvements
  in {dobldobl,quaddobl}_vlprs_algorithm.adb.

Wed 6 Jan 2016 : updated drivers_for_path_directions with routines in
  double double and quad double precision.  Added extra parameter for the
  estimated winding numbers in drivers_for_path_directions.

Tue 5 Jan 2016 : moved specifications from directions_of_standard_paths.adb
  into directions_of_standard_paths.ads, likewise did the same for
  {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl,multprec}_winding_numbers.
  Wrote better calculation of the accuracy of the extrapolated estimates
  in directions_of_standard_paths.

Sun 3 Jan 2016 : improved output for double double and quad double precision
  in ts_vlprs.adb.

Wed 18 Nov 2015 : in driver_for_winding_numbers, initialized deci to zero
  as unpreset value of the precision in the creation of the homotopy.

Thu 27 Jun 2013 : updated driver_for_winding_numbers.adb as needed for phc.

Wed 12 Jun 2013 : changed more than half of the files in this directory
  because of the introduction of natural32 and integer32 types.

Fri 8 Feb 2013 : change in driver_for_winding_numbers.adb
  for extra parameters "ls" in drivers_for_homotopy_creation.

Mon 21 Jan 2013 : creation of this directory, moving all code involving
  end games from Continuation to this new directory End_Games.
