Data management and drivers for polynomial continuation in PHCv2.4.13

In version 2.3.75, this directory was simplified with the moving of specific
code for end games, sweeps, and path trackers to separate directories.
The paragraph below describes the historical development of the original
code in this Continuation directory.

The second release brought multiprecision root refiners and the usage
of QR and Least Squares in the correctors at the end of the paths.
In version 2.1, this is extended to tracking solution paths with
multiprecision arithmetic.  Release 2.2 contains the start of
a Newton's method based on numerical differentiation routines and
supports coefficient parameter homotopy continuation.
New in release 2.3 is Newton's method with deflation for singularities
and improved endgame routines based on extrapolation methods.
Newton's method and root refiners are now in a separate directory.
Compact representation of continuation parameters and path tracking
with incremental read/write were introduced in v2.3.05.
The sweep became available via phc -p in v2.3.37 and went to significant
upgrades in v2.3.45.  In v2.3.46, multitasking was added to the blackbox 
polynomial continuation routines.  New in v2.3.58 is the introduction
of correctors with double double and quad double arithmetic.
In v2.3.59 we can run entire paths with double double arithmetic.
Overdetermined homotopies were added in version 2.4.13.

This library of continuation routines is organized in three layers:

  0. The basic data structures
  1. Increment-and-Fix continuation
  2. Driver routines

An important feature is that much of the routines in this library are
independent of how polynomials are represented.

The basic data structures allow the management of data that is generated
during the path-following.  Tuning of parameters is menu-driven.

Increment-and-Fix continuation is typical for polynomial continuation,
since paths do not turn back, when working over the complex numbers.
There is a rich variety of predictors available.
