Predictors, correctors, and path trackers in PHCv2.4.02

This directory is newly created in version 2.3.75 to focus on the
predictors, correctors, and path trackers.  Higher-order extrapolators
for use in the predictors were added in version 2.3.79.

The second release brought multi-precision root refiners and the usage
of QR and Least Squares in the correctors at the end of the paths.
In version 2.1, this is extended to tracking solution paths with
multiprecision arithmetic.  Release 2.2 contains the start of
a Newton's method based on numerical differentiation routines and
supports coefficient parameter homotopy continuation.
New in release 2.3 is Newton's method with deflation for singularities
and improved endgame routines based on extrapolation methods.
Newton's method and root refiners are now in a separate directory.
Compact representation of continuation parameters and path tracking
with incremental read/write were introduced in v2.3.05.
The sweep became available via phc -p in v2.3.37 and went to significant
upgrades in v2.3.45.  In v2.3.46, multitasking was added to the blackbox 
polynomial continuation routines.  New in v2.3.58 is the introduction
of correctors with double double and quad double arithmetic.
In v2.3.59 we can run entire paths with double double arithmetic.
Version 2.3.84 offers a basic version of a path tracker with a get_next
method, i.e.: with a generator, for use in phcpy.

An important feature is that much of the routines in this library are
independent of how polynomials are represented.
