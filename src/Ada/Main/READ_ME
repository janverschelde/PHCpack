Main interactive drivers and dispatcher for the software package PHCv2.4.13

New in release 2.1 in this directory is the conversion between symbolic 
and tableau formats, plus the interface of the solutions in Maple format.
Release 2.2 include changes in the blackbox solver (bablphc) to deal
with the special cases of one single polynomial on input.
Changes in release 2.3 are in mainzip (Maple interface),
mainvali (Newton with deflation for singularities), and
mainfeed (computing output feedback laws via pole pole placement).
A new option "phc -q" for path tracking with incremental read/write
was introduced in PHCv2.3.05.  New option 0 in phc -v with v2.3.07.
MixedVol was added in release v2.3.13, stable mixed volumes in v2.3.31.
For multitasking, a new option "phc -t" was added in release v2.3.45.
Quad double arithmetic was introduced in v2.3.55.  The blackbox solver
phc -b was extended in v2.3.68 with new tools for binomial systems,
and updated with an irreducible decomposition for binomial systems.

The are four parts in this library :

1. Separate drivers
2. Main drivers and black-box solver
3. PHCpack as server package and how to use it
4. The main dispatcher

The driver for root refinement are located at this level because symmetry
relations can be used to extract the generators of a list of solutions.
