-- DESCRIPTION :
--   A 2-stage pipeline feeds the mixed cells computed by DEMiCs
--   directly to the multitasked path trackers to solve a random
--   coefficient start system.

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Computes the lifted supports and runs the pipeline with nt tasks.

  -- ON ENTRY :
  --   dim      dimension of the points before the lifting;
  --   nt       number of tasks, must be at least two;
  --   mix      type of mixture;
  --   sup      supports of the system, orded along occurrence;
  --   lif      random lifting values for the points in the supports;
  --   verbose  if additional output is needed;
  --   monitor  if true a message will be written for each cell;
  --   vrblvl   is the verbose level.

  -- ON RETURN :
  --   q        random coefficient start system with same supports as sup;
  --   qsols    solutions of the start system q.
