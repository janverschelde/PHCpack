  to drivers_to_intersect_varieties.

Sun 21 Nov 2004 : changed drivers_to_intersect_varieties.adb to write
  witness set to file at the end of the diagonal homotopy.

Wed 25 Aug 2004 : added the use of Solu_Info_Array_List to
  intrinsic_diagonal_homotopies, for huge solution lists in testnine.

Mon 19 Jul 2004 : reporting version in standard_singular_filters prints
  a frequency table of logarithms of the condition numbers, also modified
  intrinsic_diagonal_homotopies.adb with frequency tables.

Sat 17 Jul 2004 : added generic versions to intrinsic_diagonal_homotopies,
  changed drivers_to_intersect_varieties.adb

Fri 16 Jul 2004 : created the package standard_singular_filters for use
  in intrinsic_diagonal_homotopies.adb.

Tue 13 Jul 2004 : gave the packages intrinsic_diagonal_continuation,
  intrinsic_diagonal_homotopies and intrinsic_diagonal_solvers all
  the prefix p_ (for premature and preliminary) to make way for the
  real intrinsic_diagonal_homotopies package.

Wed 23 Jun 2004 : drivers_to_intersect_varieties adjusted so that
  the polynomials can be given as generic functions.

Mon 14 Jun 2004 : dragged intersect varieties outside ts_intdia and
  created driver_to_intersect_varieties, available to call in maindeco.

Sun 6 Jun 2004 : changed drivers_to_cascade_filtering.adb to create
  separate files in the cascade with each pure dimensional solution set.

Tue 9 Mar 2004 : added ts_intcas.adb to develop cascade of homotopies
  in intrinsic coordinates.

Fri 27 Feb 2004 : changed drivers_to_cascade_filtering.adb and
  homotopy_cascade_filtering.adb due to renaming of
  black_polynomial_continuations into black_box_poly_continuations.

******************************************************* since v2.2 **

Sat Nov 18 2000: integrated homotopy test in ts_irco.

Sun 5 Dec 2000 : worked on Witness_Classify, updates in ts_irdeco.adb,
  irreducible_decompositions.adb and witness_generate_and_classify.adb.

Tue 22 May 2001 : enlarged the menu structure of ts_irco, modified the
  packages irreducible_component_creators and irreducible_component_lists
  to allow trace interpolation
Wed 23 May 2001 : continued modifications, trace interpolation runs

Tue 5 June 2001 : inserted linear trace interpolation for higher dimensions

Thu 14 June 2001 : ts_sqem.adb implements squaring and embedding, we cannot
  separate the one from the other

Sun 24 June 2001 : irreducible_component_creators now also call the
  trace interpolators for more than one dimension

Fri 20 July 2001 : introduced mainfac and maindeco (instead of maincomp),
  new driver_to_factor_components contains much of what was in ts_irco.

Sat 21 July 2001 : found that we do not really need higher dimensional
  linear traces, changed irreducible_component_lists.adb and 
  irreducible_component_creators.adb.

Mon 30 July 2001 : integration of power traces in phc requires modification
  of driver_to_factor_components.adb, irreducible_component_lists, and
  irreducible_component_creators.

Thu 2 Aug 2001 : phc -f now calls the polynomial factorization routines,
  modified mainfac.adb for this.

Thu 9 Aug 2001 : fixed bug in mainfac.adb, the variable "dim" was not
  assigned when the input file was not on the command line.

Sat 27 Oct 2001 : finished operational version of ts_mbthom.adb, a first
  version to add the homotopy membership test to the validation module

Wed 20 Mar 2002 : started with ts_intvar.adb, to develop a new tool to phc
  to intersect pure dimensional varieties

Sun 24 Mar 2002 : lifted the functionality from ts_cascade.adb into the
  phc -c, maindeco.adb, upgrading drivers_to_cascade_filtering.
  Created new package homotopy_membership_tests, lifted from ts_mbthom.

Mon 25 Mar 2002 : created ts_filfac.adb as intermediate to upgrade mainfac.
  The driver_to_factor_components was upgraded to a package, called
  drivers_to_factor_components.

Mon 8 Apr 2002 : upgraded drivers_to_cascade_filtering.adb to enable the
  elimination of variables by special slices.

Tue 9 Apr 2002 : upgraded mainfac.adb so that it now contains ts_elim.adb.

Sun 26 May 2002 : created the package diagonal_homotopies, from the
  operations from ts_intvar.adb.

Mon 27 May 2002 : due to a change from slice_and_embed_components into
  witness_points, many packages and ts_ files had their headers updated.

Tue 4 June 2002 : problems with mainfac.adb, the link with monodromy was
  not made appropriately!

*** more adequate bookkeeping needed since release v2.2alpha on 5/30/03 ***

Tue 3 June 2003 : changed drivers_for_cascade_filtering.adb to accomodate
  for the embedding of the equation of a cylinder

Wed 4 June 2003 : added Truncate to extrinsic_diagonal_homotopies and
  changed extrinsic_diagonal_solvers
