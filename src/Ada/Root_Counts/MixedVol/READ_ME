The MixedVol Algorithm for fast mixed volume computation in PHCv2.4.91

This directory is the main feature in release v2.3.13 of PHCpack.
Since v2.3.31, support for stable mixed volumes was added.

This directory contains a translation of the C software "MixedVol" to 
compute mixed volumes fast, derived from the code "MixedVol", described in

  Tangan Gao, T. Y. Li, Mengnien Wu:
  "Algorithm 846: MixedVol: a software package for mixed-volume computation"
  ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS), 31(4):555-560, 2005.

Their "ReadMe" file in the distribution of the software contains the following
lines (showing that Xing Li contributed as well):
"MixedVol: Polynomial system mixed volume calculation program.

The conversion of the source code from C++ down to C was done by Yan Zhuang.

The program "ts_mv2c.adb" calls the C software "MixedVol" via
the intermediate interface program mv.c.

Run "gprbuild mixedvol.gpr" to make test procedures.
On windows, type "gprbuild mixedvol.gpr -Xos=windows"
at the PowerShell prompt.
The "gprclean mixedvol.gpr" removes all files created by gprbuild.
