Dynamic Enumeration of all Mixed Cells in PHCv2.4.86

This directory was added in version 2.4.53 to prepare the interface
to DEMiCs, software for the dynamic enumeration of all mixed cells.
This software was developed by Tomohiko Mizutani, Akiko Takeda,
and Masakazu Kojima and licensed under GNU GPL Version 2 or higher.

The first interface is a simple file based interface,
which assumes the executable is available as /tmp/demics
on UNIX like systems such as Mac OS X and Linux.
This first interface is tested by ts_calldemics.

The original C++ code is included, after reformatting and removal of
many superfluous blank lines.  The README.txt is copied from the SRC
folder of the DEMiCs.0951 distribution archive.
This README.txt describes the definition of the input files and the
option to the executable demics.

The second interface links with the original C++ code directly.
To integrate the original C++ code, it should be compiled with
a particular flag to apply the modifications to run demics silently
and write the output into the proper output data suitable for processing.
This second interface is defined by the package DEMiCs_Algorithm
and is tested by ts_demicsrun.

Modifications made to the code of DEMiCs (for callback operations and
directly processing of the cells) is within #if blocks, compiled when
the flag compile4phc is set.  See the makefiles in the Objects folder
for the compilation instructions.

The switches "-Dcompilewgpp=1" and "-Dcompile4phc=1" are critical,
see the demics.gpr file.

Run "gprbuild demics.gpr" to make all test programs.
On windows, type "gprbuild demics.gpr -Xos=windows"
at the PowerShell prompt.
The "gprclean demics.gpr" removes all files created by gprbuild.
