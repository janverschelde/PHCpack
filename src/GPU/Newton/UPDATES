  added function to read an exponent matrix.  Bug fix in test_dbl2_newton.cpp.
  New dbl_newton_testers.h and dbl_newton_testers.cpp with code extracted
  from test_dbl_newton.cpp.

Thu 26 May 2022 : after a bug fix in dbl_monomials_host.cpp,
  the test_dbl_newton.cpp works.  Added double double versions.

Sun 22 May 2022 : new dbl_linearized_solvers, to solve linear systems of
  power series by lineariziation, extracted from test_dbl_newton.cpp.

Thu 19 May 2022 : new unimodular_matrices, to define the test monomial
  homotopy, with code taken from test_dbl_newton.cpp.
