Fri 10 Feb 2017 : move writing and tuning of the parameters from the
  test_parameter.cpp to a new parameter.cpp file, with added headers
  to the parameter.h, so writing and tuning belong to the parameter class.

Wed 8 Feb 2017 : new test program test_parameter.cpp to prepare for the
  interactive tuning of the parameters, implemented by the tune function.

Mon 6 Feb 2017 : stored the t value at the end of the paths in path_host.tpp,
  path_track.tpp, improved newton_host.tpp, and copied the final value of t
  to the solutions in the container, in the code of lib2path.cpp.

Sat 4 Feb 2017 : extended parameter.h with a constructor with default values
  of the parameters, cleaned up path_track.tpp, test_path.cpp,
  and also test_newton.cpp.  Added default values for double double and 
  quad double runs in parameter.h, used in path_track.tpp.
  The new defaults for parameters are used in lib2path.cpp.
  Improved newton_host.tpp, with a better test in test_newton.cpp.

Thu 2 Feb 2017 : to lib2path.h and lib2path.cpp, added interface functions
  to be called directly from C++.

Tue 31 Jan 2017 : added tracking of many paths to lib2path.h and lib2path.cpp.
  To lib2path.h and lib2path.cpp added Newton and the one path tracker.

Mon 30 Jan 2017 : arranged the printing in test_path.cpp so that it takes
  the working precision into account.  Added description to path_track.h.

Sun 29 Jan 2017 : reading of start system and start solutions added to
  test_path.cpp.  With code from ade_manypaths_d.cpp in Ada/PHCtoC
  defined the path_track.h and path_track.cpp, for use in test_path.cpp.
  
Sat 28 Jan 2017 : rewrote test_eval.cpp into a templated version,
  with better separation of tasks in separate functions.
  Fixed bug in test_eval.cpp, must pass PolySys objects by reference.
  Updated test_newton.cpp for templates and call by reference.
  Initial version of predictor_host.h, predictor_host.tpp, path_host,
  path_host.tpp, tested by test_path.cpp, with updated makefile.
  Joined ada_test_d, ada_test_dd, and ada_test_qd into lib2path
  to connect the lib interface to PHCpack to the Path data structures.

Fri 27 Jan 2017 : first templated version of newton_host.h, with the
  templated code in newton_host.tpp.  Added instructions to the makefile
  to compile the new test program test_newton.cpp.

Thu 26 Jan 2017 : removed the allocation for the result of the evaluation
  in test_eval.cpp.  Fixed path_data.h, path_data.tpp, parameter.h,
  varset.h, eval_host.h, eval_host.tpp, and test_eval.cpp.
  Defined a templated test program in test_eval.cpp.
  Placed guards to the delete statements in path_data.h, eval_host.h,
  and workspace_host.h.  Wrote 2 documentation strings in eval_host.h,
  to document the top level evaluation and differentiation operations.

Wed 25 Jan 2017 : made a first pass through eval_host.h and eval_host.tpp
  adding template directives wherever needed.  New test_eval.cpp to
  evaluate a polynomial system, with make instructions in the makefile.

Tue 24 Jan 2017 : added path_data, copied from Main, where it should not be,
  because needed by eval_host, and added workspace_host.
  Copied from Path_CPU the code for varset.h (added templates),
  also copied parameter.h, and the file eval_host.h (added templates).
  Renamed eval_host.cpp into eval_host.tpp.
