Thu 20 Aug 2015 : reformatted code in path_gpu.cu and path_multi_gpu.cu.

Mon 17 Aug 2015 : newton_single2() had to be used in newton.cu,
  with more upgrades for the evaluation and differentiation.

Thu 2 Jul 2015 : in newton.cu, changed on line 1239, the call to newton()
  into the call to newton_single().
