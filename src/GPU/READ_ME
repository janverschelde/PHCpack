GPU acceleration of polynomial homotopy continuation in PHCv2.3.99

This directory contains code for the GPU, developed in collaboration
with Genady Yoffe and Xiangcheng Yu, for the NVIDIA Tesla C2050 and K20C.

The directories are organized in chronological order:

PED : Polynomial Evaluation and Differentiation,
      the paper was presented at PDSEC 2012 in Shanghai.

MGS : version of modified Gram-Schmidt method,
      the paper was presented at PDSEC 2013 in Boston.

MGS2 : version 2 of MGS for larger dimensions, combined with Newton's method,
       presented at HPCC 2014 in Paris.

The code in PED, MGS, and MGS2 are standalone, apart from PHCpack,
with their own specific makefiles and running modes.

Path : accelerated path tracking, as standalone package, and with
       integration into PHCpack, for presentation at ISSAC 2015,
       PASCO 2015, and HPCC 2015 (in this chronological order).
