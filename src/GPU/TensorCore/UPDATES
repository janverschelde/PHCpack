Tue 20 Jan 2026 : extended double_matrix_multiplications with single indexed
  multiplication and conversion functions, tested by test_mmm.
  Updated all makefiles.  Extended test_vdd with single indexed mmm.
  Small edit in vectored_quad_doubles.h; to test_vqd, added the
  application of the single indexed matrix matrix multiplication.
  Another small edit in vectord_quad_doubles.h; extended ts_vod and
  vectored_octo_doubles with quartered matrix multiplication.

Mon 19 Jan 2026 : renamed transpose_quarters into transpose_dd_quarters
  in vectored_double_doubles, fixed bug in test_vdd.cpp.
  To vectored_quad_doubles, added the vectored_quad_matmatmul, tested
  by test_vqd.cpp.  Updated splitting_doubles.cpp for compiler warning.
  New double_matrix_multiplications, applied in test_vdd, with functions
  added in vectored_double_doubles to compute convolute and stacked
  quartered matrices.  Updated makefiles.  To vectored_double_doubles,
  added function to extract the quarters out of the quartered product,
  tested in test_vdd.cpp.  Edited test_vdd.cpp, vectores_double_doubles.h,
  extended vectored_quad_doubles and test_vqd.cpp with convolution and
  stacked matrices and their double indexed matrix multiplication.
  Updated the makefiles.

Sun 18 Jan 2026 : extended vectored_octo_doubles with matrix matrix
  multiplications.  Small edits in test_vdd.cpp, test_vqd.cpp, extended
  test_vod.cpp, edited test_vhd.cpp, updated makefiles.
  Small edit in test_vod.cpp.  Extended vectored_hexa_doubles and
  test_vhd.cpp; updated makefiles.  To vectored_double_doubles, added
  functions to make a vectored matrix multiplication, tested by test_vdd.

Sat 17 Jan 2026 : extended vectored_{double,quad}_doubles and test_vdd.cpp,
  test_vqd.cpp with functions for matrix matrix multiplication.

Fri 16 Jan 2026 : completed vectored_hexa_doubles and test_vhd.cp.
  Minor edit in vectored_octo_doubles.h.

Thu 15 Jan 2026 : added new vectored_octo_doubles, tested by ts_vod.cpp,

Wed 14 Jan 2026 : fixed error in first fail computation in ts_vdd.cpp.
  Defined the splitting of quad doubles in vectored_quad_doubles,
  tested by test_vqd.cpp.  Updates the makefiles.
  Extended vectored_quad_doubles and test_vqd with vectored qd product.

Tue 13 Jan 2026 : moved splitting_doubles.c into splitting_doubles.cpp,
  extracting tests into test_splitting_doubles.cpp, updated makefiles.
  New vectored_double_doubles to define vectored double double arithmetic,
  tested by ts_vdd.cpp; updated the makefile.

Sun 11 Jan 2026 : extended splitting_doubles with quarter split function.

Sat 10 Jan 2026 : added bits_of_pi.c as test on frexp() and ldexp().
