Via some interesting use cases, several features are introduced.

1. If one can solve polynomial systems,
   then one can solve many problems,
   as illustrated by the wide variety of application areas.

2. The use cases illustrate the formulation of the polynomial systems
   via the packages in Python's computational ecosystem,
   in particular sympy and numpy.

3. The interpretation of the output often happens via plots.

For the plots, Jupyter notebooks are available in the ``tests`` folder.
The development of the use cases happened via short Python scripts.

In the ``phcpy`` context, solving a problem includes the writing
of scripts which formulate the polynomial system that define the problem
and the scripts which verify and interpret the solutions.
