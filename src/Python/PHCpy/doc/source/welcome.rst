This documentation describes a Python package
to compute solutions of polynomial systems using PHCpack.

The computation of the mixed volume in phcpy calls MixedVol
(ACM TOMS Algorithm 846 of T. Gao, T.Y. Li, M. Wu) 
as it is integrated in PHCpack.
DEMiCs (Dynamic Enumeration of all Mixed Cells,
by T. Mizutani, A. Takeda, and M. Kojima) is faster than MixedVol
for larger systems with many different supports.
A function to compute mixed volumes with DEMiCs is available in phcpy.

For double double and quad double arithmetic, PHCpack incorporates
the QD library of Y. Hida, X.S. Li, and D.H. Bailey
and code generated by the CAMPARY library.
CAMPARY is the CudA Multiple Precision ARithmetic librarY,
by Mioara Joldes, Olivier Marty, Jean-Michel Muller,
Valentina Popescu and Warwick Tucker.

what is phcpy?
==============

The main executable phc (polynomial homotopy continuation)
defined by the source code in PHCpack is a menu driven
and file oriented program.
The Python interface defined by phcpy replaces the files
with persistent objects allowing the user to work with
scripts or in interactive sessions.
The computationally intensive tasks such as path tracking
and mixed volume computations are executed as compiled code
so there will not be a loss of efficiency.

Both phcpy and PHCpack are free and open source software packages;
you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the

At the poster session EuroSciPy 2013, questions from Max Demenkov 
led to development of a step-by-step path tracker, a process in which
the user can control the pace of the tracker, asking for the next
point on a solution path, which is very convenient for plotting.
This is one of the features of ``phcpy`` which makes PHCpack more
versatile to the Python programmer.

installing phcpy
================

The installation requires the library files
``libPHCpack.so`` (Linux), ``libPHCpack.dll`` (windows), and
``libPHCpack.dylib`` (Mac OS X) to be present in the folder 
that holds the modules of ``phcpy``.

The file ``setup.py`` defines the instructions to install
and is located of the parent folder of ``phcpy`` modules.

Then the installation happens simply via

::

   pip install .

executed at the command prompt in the folder where ``setup.py``
is located.
The installation may require superuser priveleges 
and on older systems with a python2 present, ``pip3`` may be needed.

To make the library files ``libPHCpack``, one can use the 
alire crate ``phcpack``.  
Alire <https://alire.ada.dev> is the name of the package
manager of Ada.
