This folder contains test scripts to help the phcpy development.

| testimport.py  | does the import phcpy work in a script?    |
| apollonius.py  | computes all circles tangent to 3 circles  |
| fourbar.py     | design of a 4-bar mechanism                |
| fourlines.py   | two lines meeting four lines in 3-space    |
| showpaths.py   | plots four paths in a simple homotopy      |
| showpoles.py   | shows the poles closest to four paths      |

The apollonius.py, fourbar.py, and fourlines.py correspond to
the use cases in the tutorial of the phcpy documentation.
The plots by showpaths.py are made with aposteriori step size control,
and plots by showpoles.py are done with apriori step size control.
