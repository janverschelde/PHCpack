Thu 21 Dec 2023 : added Pade approximants to series.
  Extended dimension with a function to get the number of available cores.
  Extended dimension for Laurent polynomials.

Wed 20 Dec 2023 : extended solver.py with trinomial system test.
  Extended solutions.py with the functions and class from phcpy.solutions.
  Improved version.py for pylint recommendations.
  Extended series.py with newton starting at series.

Tue 19 Dec 2023 : added tests to version.py and fixed the format
  conversions for all 32-bit natural numbers.  Fixed buffer size 
  in polynomials.py; initialized buffers in solutions.py and solver.py.
  First working version of series.py in double precision.
  Extended series.py to double double and quad double precision.

Mon 18 Dec 2023 : attempt to fix int4a2nbr() in version.py for numbers
  larger than 255.  Updates in solutions.py.

Sun 17 Dec 2023 : extended polynomials.py for nonsquare polynomial systems.
  Extended polynomials.py with functions to store many polynomial systems.
  Extended solutions.py with functions to append solution strings.
  In solver.py, doubled the size of the buffer for the root counter string.

Sat 16 Dec 2023 : extended dimension.py, polynomials.py, solutions.py,
  and solver.py for double double and quad double precisions.

Sat 21 Jan 2023 : in version.py renamed the function getPHCmod into 
  get_phcfun which returned the function instead of the module.
  All other .py files were adjusted which led to close to perfect
  pylint scores.

Fri 20 Jan 2023 : extended solutions.py to write all solutions
  stored in double precision.

Thu 19 Jan 2023 : started solutions.py ...  Ran pylint on all .py files
  and convert camel case to snake case of function names.

Wed 18 Jan 2023 : edits to version.py, dimension.py, polynomials.py,
  volumes.py and solver.py for pylint warnings, for improved ratings.

Tue 17 Jan 2023 : in solver.py, used int.from_bytes() on a[0] to get the
  number of solutions returned as an integer.

Mon 16 Jan 2023 : extended version.py with int4a2str and str2int4a functions.
  Extended version.py with int4a2nbr function, improved dimension.py,
  and added a new module polynomials.  New volumes.py to export functions
  to compute mixed volumes and stable mixed volumes.
  The blackbox solver is wrapped in the new solver.py module.

Sun 15 Jan 2023 : made version.py platform independent, as it works for
  windows, macos X (both Intel and M1), and linux (of course).
  Extended version.py with the function getPHCmod() to give access to
  the shared object or dynamic library in a platform independent manner.
  New dimension.py to get the number of polynomials in double precision.
