Mon 16 Jan 2023 : extended version.py with int4a2str and str2int4a functions.
  Extended version.py with int4a2nbr function, improved dimension.py,
  and added a new module polynomials.  New volumes.py to export functions
  to compute mixed volumes and stable mixed volumes.
  The blackbox solver is wrapped in the new solver.py module.

Sun 15 Jan 2023 : made version.py platform independent, as it works for
  windows, macos X (both Intel and M1), and linux (of course).
  Extended version.py with the function getPHCmod() to give access to
  the shared object or dynamic library in a platform independent manner.
  New dimension.py to get the number of polynomials in double precision.
