Sat 21 Jan 2023 : in version.py renamed the function getPHCmod into 
  get_phcfun which returned the function instead of the module.
  All other .py files were adjusted which led to close to perfect
  pylint scores.

Fri 20 Jan 2023 : extended solutions.py to write all solutions
  stored in double precision.

Thu 19 Jan 2023 : started solutions.py ...  Ran pylint on all .py files
  and convert camel case to snake case of function names.

Wed 18 Jan 2023 : edits to version.py, dimension.py, polynomials.py,
  volumes.py and solver.py for pylint warnings, for improved ratings.

Tue 17 Jan 2023 : in solver.py, used int.from_bytes() on a[0] to get the
  number of solutions returned as an integer.

Mon 16 Jan 2023 : extended version.py with int4a2str and str2int4a functions.
  Extended version.py with int4a2nbr function, improved dimension.py,
  and added a new module polynomials.  New volumes.py to export functions
  to compute mixed volumes and stable mixed volumes.
  The blackbox solver is wrapped in the new solver.py module.

Sun 15 Jan 2023 : made version.py platform independent, as it works for
  windows, macos X (both Intel and M1), and linux (of course).
  Extended version.py with the function getPHCmod() to give access to
  the shared object or dynamic library in a platform independent manner.
  New dimension.py to get the number of polynomials in double precision.
