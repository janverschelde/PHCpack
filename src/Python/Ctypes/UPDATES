Sun 15 Jan 2023 : made version.py platform independent, as it works for
  windows, macos X (both Intel and M1), and linux (of course).
  Extended version.py with the function getPHCmod() to give access to
  the shared object or dynamic library in a platform independent manner.
  New dimension.py to get the number of polynomials in double precision.
