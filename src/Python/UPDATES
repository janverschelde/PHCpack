Thu 27 Dec 2012 : added monodromy_breakup to phcsets.py.

Wed 19 Dec 2012 : added Newton_step to phcpy.py and changed schubert.py.
  Wrapping of celcon led to random_coefficient_system in phcpy.py.

Tue 18 Dec 2012 : updates in schubert.py

Thu 13 Dec 2012 : the run_pieri_homotopies gets system and solutions
  from the containers which can then be tested with phcsols.

Wed 12 Dec 2012 : random input data is generated by schubert.py
  and passed to the run_Pieri_homotopies method.

Tue 11 Dec 2012 : new schubert.py exports Pieri root count.

Sun 9 Dec 2012 : new phcsets.py to manipulate algebraic sets.

Wed 5 Dec 2012 : extended phcpy.py with test_track, improved phcsols.py.

Tue 4 Dec 2012 : updates in phcpy.py and examples.py.
  Added a silent flag to phcpy.solve and stable flag to phcpy.mixed_volume.

Sun 2 Dec 2012 : added banners to the tests in examples.py.

Sat 1 Dec 2012 : added "binomials", "d1", "game4two", katsura6", "noon3",
  "rps10", and "tangents" to examples.py, so now there are 10 examples.

Fri 30 Nov 2012 : added "stewgou40" to examples.py and then discovered
  that this example no longer works!

Thu 29 Nov 2012 : added "test" function to phcpy.p and fixed phcwulf.py
  on dezon: closing the server before all handler threads are finished
  is a very bad thing to do!  Replaced "remove_padding" by "strip".
  Added examples.py and the doc directory to generate documentation
  with sphinx.

Wed 28 Nov 2012 : updated makefile_unix so the python interface works
  on Redhat 6.3 with python2.6 and GNAT GPL 2012.  New module phcsols.py
  to convert solutions in PHCpack string format to dictionaries.

Tue 6 Sep 2011 : updated makefile_mac so the python interface works
  on MacOS X!

Wed 30 Jul 2008 : added line to print number of solutions client sends
  in phcwulf.py to track down a bug.

Thu 5 Jun 2008 : random_trinomials() added to phcpy.py and used in
